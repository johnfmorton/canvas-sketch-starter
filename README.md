# Notes

This project exposes the project on port 8888. This is because I use NPM in a Docker container that exposes port 8888 from the npm container to my local machine. This is why the `npm run dev` command has the port option changed from the default port.


## Starting

To start a sketch, open this containing directory in the terminal and start the project like this:

```
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8888 in your browser.
